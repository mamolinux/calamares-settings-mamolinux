# Size and expansion policy for Calamares.
#  - "normal" or unset, expand as needed, use *windowSize*
#  - "fullscreen", start as large as possible, ignore *windowSize*
#  - "noexpand", don't expand automatically, use *windowSize*
windowExpanding:    normal

# Size of Calamares window, expressed as w,h. Both w and h
# may be either pixels (suffix px) or font-units (suffix em).
#   e.g.    "800px,600px"
#           "60em,480px"
# This setting is ignored if "fullscreen" is selected for
# *windowExpanding*, above. If not set, use constants defined
# in CalamaresUtilsGui, 800x520.
windowSize: 800px,600px

# Placement of Calamares window. Either "center" or "free".
# Whether "center" actually works does depend on the window
# manager in use (and only makes sense if you're not using
# *windowExpanding* set to "fullscreen").
windowPlacement: center
